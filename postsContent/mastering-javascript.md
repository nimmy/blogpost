JavaScript powers the web - it's **the** most important programming language you need to know as a web developer.

NextJS is a **framework for ReactJS**.

Wait a second ... a "framework" for React? Isn't React itself already a framework for JavaScript?

Well ... first of all, React is a "library" for JavaScript. That seems to be important for some people.

Not for me, but still, there is a valid point: React already is a framework / library for JavaScript. So it's already an extra layer on top of JS.

## Why would we then need NextJS?

Because NextJS makes building React apps easier - especially React apps that should have server-side rendering (though it does way more than just take care of that).

In this article, we'll dive into the core concepts and features NextJS has to offer:

- File-based Routing
- Built-in Page Pre-rendering
- Rich Data Fetching Capabilities
- Image Optimization
- Much More

## File-based Routing

For example, you should understand code like this:

```js
const basics = 'Okay, that should not be too difficult actually';

function printBasics() {
  console.log(basics):
}

printBasics();
```
